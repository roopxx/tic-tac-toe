# Tic-Tac-Toe

This project helped me learn about modules and factory functions in JavaScript. I organized the code into three modules: gameBoard, displayController, and Player. Factory functions allowed creating player objects with distinct names and markers. Difficulties included organizing the code and implementing game logic, but I overcame them with careful planning and problem-solving. Overall, the project improved my coding skills and understanding of modular design.
